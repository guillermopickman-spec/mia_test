The "Master Implementation" Prompt
Context: I have a FastAPI backend (MIA v1.2) deployed on Render and a PostgreSQL DB on Neon. Goal: Create a modern, robust, and free front end using Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI to be deployed on Vercel.

Task Instructions for Agent:

Scaffold: Initialize a Next.js 15 project in a new /frontend directory.

UI System: Install and configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI. Use a "Dark Industrial" theme (Slate/Zinc) to match the "Market Intelligence Agent" brand.

Connection: Create a centralized api.ts utility using fetch to communicate with my Render URL (use an environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL).

Core Pages:

Dashboard: A grid showing real-time stats from the Neon DB (GPU prices, scan history).

Agent Terminal: A chat-style interface to trigger the MIA ReAct loop. It must handle Streaming Responses from FastAPI so I can see the "thinking" steps.

Reports: A clean table view for technical reconnaissance reports.

Robustness: Implement Zod for schema validation and React Query (TanStack) for caching and loading states.

Backend Bridge: Update my existing FastAPI main.py to include the necessary CORSMiddleware for the new Vercel domain.

Deployment: Generate a vercel.json and a README with the exact environment variables needed for Vercel.

Constraint: Do not use any paid libraries. Keep the bundle size small. Prioritize "Lucide-React" for icons.
